# dispatch-proxy
ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

Same as the original but with some wanted changes for specific use home usage cases (streaming, downloading and etc)

# Why?
So people that don't have stable download/upload bandwidth don't make 1 connection suffer because of a slow down on the main or secondary one,  so instead of using speed ratios, the exact speeds for each connection will be put in before running the proxy.
